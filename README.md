DotNetify makes it super easy to connect your React Native mobile app to a cross-platform .NET back-end and get real-time two-way communication with WebSockets for free!

This demo was bootstrapped with [create-react-native-app](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app.html).

### How To Run
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowscmd).

Follow the [instructions on Expo website](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html) to install Genymotion Android emulator and/or download the Expo app for iOS or Android.

Run the client on a terminal:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Open another terminal and run the server:
```
